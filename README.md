# Predicting aerodynamic characteristics of airfoils using ANN

Airfoil coordinates (X, Y ), angle of attack (α), Reynolds number (Re), lift coefficient (C<sub>L</sub>) and drag coefficient (C<sub>D</sub>) are the features of the dataset. 

1. Airfoils: NACA 0012, NACA 0015, NACA 0018 NACA 0021 and NACA 0025.
2. Airfoil Tools was used to generate airfoil coordinates (X,Y).
3. Wind turbine experimental data was used to get rest of the features (α, Re, C<sub>L</sub> and C<sub>D</sub>).
4. Angle of attack (α) is in the range of (0◦ ≤ α ≤ 180◦).
5. Reynolds number (Re) is in the range of (10<sup>4</sup> ≤ Re ≤ 10<sup>7</sup>).
6. Observations with the Reynolds number (Re) of 1.6 x 10<sup>5</sup> were separated and used as test data.
7. Training data : 2598
8. Test data: 80
